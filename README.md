## Usage and User Stories

(currently a heavy work in progress) With DeeTS, users may easily build themselves a simple profile for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. A Smash player may create an account on the site to input their name, profile picture, fun biographic details, their play data when it comes to tourney participation, and their mains, or characters they most often use while playing Smash. Additionally, a smasher may view other users' profiles to check out their own mains and other fun statistics and details. Make friends, then settle it in Smash, by learning all about their DeeTS!

## CSS Framework Details

Bootstrap, specifically [Bootstrap version 4.5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/), the CSS framework that serves as a powerful tool for designing applications professionally and easily. After linking Bootstrap's CSS and JS links into our handlebars--which of course means the framework is perfectly functional with traditional HTML as well--a number of prebuilt classes instantly become available for use anywhere in the HTML. In addition, the classes are flexible enough to be further modified in our own local CSS file when needed. Bootstrap utilizes a grid system, allowing simple organization of elements by assigning them to specific rows and columns. We also utilized their handy button styling for buttons throughout the site, as well as their prebuilt modals. Additionally, Bootstrap is built with mobile devices in mind first, ascertaining the elements comfortably fit on all screen sizes.
